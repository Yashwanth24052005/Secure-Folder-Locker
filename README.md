Secure Folder Locker
Secure Folder Locker is a Python-based GUI application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt folders with an extra layer of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using Google Authenticator.
It hides folders, removes inherited permissions during encryption, and restores them during decryption.

‚ú® Features
Folder Encryption: Encrypts all files in a folder using AES encryption.

Folder Hiding: Automatically hides the encrypted folder and its contents.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Uses Google Authenticator for secure folder decryption.

Permission Management: Revokes and restores folder permissions automatically.

Simple GUI: Easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter.

2FA adds a second layer of security to protect your sensitive data.
